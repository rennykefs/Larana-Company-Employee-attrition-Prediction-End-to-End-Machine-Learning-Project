# Larana-Company-Employee-attrition-Prediction-End-to-End-Machine-Learning and Data Science Project
Developed to help Larana company understand and predict employee attrition and identify key factors influencing employee turnover and provide actionable insights to HR departments

## Project Overview
This project was developed to help organisations understand and predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and provide actionable insights to HR departments.

The project allows a full data science workflow:
- EDA
- Feature Engineering
- Productive Modeling
- Business Insights and Recommendations

## Business Problem
Larana company is experiencing high employee turnover
Replacing employees is costly and distrupts operations
This project aims to :
- Predict which employees are likely to leave
- Understand the main drivers of attrition
- Provide data driven retention strategies

## Dataset
The dataset contains HR records of employees including:
- Demographics
- Job role and department
- Satisfaction levels
- Salary inforamtion
- Work life balance
- Overtime

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Project Workflow
### 1. EDA
- Data cleaning
- Missing value Handling
- Correlation analysis
- Visualization of trends
### 2. Feature Engineering
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Feature Selection
### 3. Modeling
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Classifier
- SGD Classifier
### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

## Best Model
After comparing multiple algorithms, the best performing model was:
**SGD classifier** 
- Highest Recall for identifying at risk employees
- Best ROC-AUC score
- Balanced Performance across metrics

## Key Business Insights
- Overtime is the strongest driver of attrition
- Low job satisfaction increases turnover risk
- Lower income groups have higher turnover
- New employees(first 2 years) are most likely to leave

##Business Recommendations
- Reduce excessive overtime
- Implement employee engagement programs
- Review compensation policies
- Focus retention strategies on early-career staff
